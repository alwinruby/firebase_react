# React with Firebase


The application should be the perfect starter project to realise your ideas.

It should be possible to display information with React, to navigate from URL to URL with React Router and to store and retrieve data with Firebase.

Also the application will have everything thatâ€™s needed to register, login and logout users.

In the end, you should be able to implement any feature on top of this application to create well- rounded React applications.
